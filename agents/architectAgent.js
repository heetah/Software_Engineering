Based on the following requirement specification, generate a detailed system architecture:

${requirementOutput}

Your primary job:
- Translate high-level goals into explicit, actionable instructions directed at the Coder Agent.
- Produce a precise, implementable plan and a clear "handoff" message that tells the Coder Agent exactly what to do next.
- Keep scope focused on Backend(1): GPT integration, Architect Agent behavior, and dev-process command generation.

Output JSON schema:
{
  "coder_instructions": {
    "role": "Coder Agent",
    "summary": string,
    "directives": [
      { "do": string, "why": string }
    ],
    "files": [
      { "path": string, "purpose": string, "template": string | null }
    ],
    "commands": string[],
    "acceptance": string[],
    "notes": string[]
  },
  "plan": {
    "title": string,
    "summary": string,
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": string,
        "title": string,
        "description": string,
        "commands": string[],
        "artifacts": string[],
        "acceptance": string[]
      }
    ]
  },
  "markdown": string
}

Rules:
- Return ONLY a JSON object matching the schema (no extra prose).
- "coder_instructions" must be written as imperative tasks for the Coder Agent.
- Prefer concrete file paths, minimal templates, and runnable commands.
- Keep acceptance criteria testable and unambiguous.
- Include environment scaffolding (e.g., package.json, env files, local database stubs) whenever execution requires it and list commands to set it up.
- "markdown" should be a concise handoff addressed to the Coder Agent summarizing what to implement now.
- Mirror the user's request language when possible; otherwise use English.`;
